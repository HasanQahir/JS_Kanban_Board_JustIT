This Kanbon board has the following implemented features:

**Drag & Drop active for all tiles.** These can only be placed in one of the columns, and a white dashed outline will indicate which column it will be placed in. 
Cards will be inserted into the column wherever the mouse is released. The horizontal centre of a tile is the boundary for this.

**Title and Description text fields. Both editable.** Hovering over a tile will show a pen icon in the top-right corner, and clicking on this reveals the edit box.
Aftering making an edit, pressing 'confirm' will update the tile's text while 'cancel' will close the box.

Besides editing, you can also delete a task from this panel with the strongly indicative red 'delete' button.

_There is no warning prompt when deleting!!_

**Add more tiles to a column.** New tiles can be added to a column by clicking the '+' icon in the top-right of every column header. These start with a default title and description,
the edit box will automatically open and display a new tile so it may be edited immediately.
